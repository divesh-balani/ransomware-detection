#Secure Solution Implementation document


This document outlines the implementation details for a cybersecurity project developed as part of a group effort in a cybersecurity course. The project focuses on creating a secure environment for a hospital setting, drawing inspiration from the 2017 NHS WannaCry ransomware attack. The goal is to design a secure environment and implement security measures to protect hospital networks from similar threats. We aim to ensure the safety of sensitive patient data.
The project leverages a combination of Virtual Machines (VMs) running Linux servers and Windows VPN workspaces. Key components of the secure environment include the deployment of antivirus software, configuration of firewalls with specific rules, and the integration of Host-based Intrusion Detection Systems (HIDS) and Network-based Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS). Through this comprehensive approach, the project aims to demonstrate effective strategies for malware detection and overall network security in a healthcare context.
This document details the setup and configuration processes for each security measure we took. Here, we will be providing instructions regarding the steps we took to create a secure environment. The implementation aims to offer a practical guide for protecting healthcare environments from cyber threats, ensuring both data security and operational continuity.
